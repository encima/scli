# SCLI

# What?

An idea that came to me as I was writing [bookshel](https://github.com/encima/bookshelf). A terminal based speed reading client in VERY EARLY stages.

# How?

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/encima/scli
```

# TODO

* [] Better formatting of retrieved HTML
* [] Attempt to extract only article content
* [] Support for more than just txt
* [] Support for plain text as an argument
