Use case: the files to be processed are in an ASCII compatible encoding, but you donâ€™t know exactly which one. All files must be processed without triggering any exceptions, but some Unicode related errors are acceptable in order to reduce the risk of data corruption (e.g. collating log files from multiple sources, but wanting more explicit notification when the collated data is at risk of corruption due to programming errors that violate the assumption of writing the data back out only in its original encoding)
